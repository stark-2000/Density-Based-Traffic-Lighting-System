## Overview:
Created a 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 prototype, dynamically adjusting 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 at intersections based on 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲. Utilizes 𝐈𝐑 𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲 𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐬 embedded in roads for vehicle detection, enabling 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦-𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐧 signal adjustments.

## Key Achievements:
✦ 𝐃𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠:
Adapts signal timings at intersections based on 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜 density, enhancing traffic flow and reducing congestion.

✦ 𝐈𝐑 𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲 𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐬:
Embedded in roads for precise 𝐯𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, providing feedback to the smart algorithm for timely signal adjustments.

✦ 𝐀𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦-𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥:
Utilizes a smart algorithm to analyze sensor data and dynamically alter signal timings, optimizing traffic management.

✦ 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭:
Implemented with 𝐈𝐑 𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲 sensors and 𝐀𝐫𝐝𝐮𝐢𝐧𝐨 𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐫, showcasing feasibility and effectiveness for 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 deployment.
